    "You can also see where your visitors are coming from, keep an eye on your pageview-to-click conversion rates, and much more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of having to deduce what’s going on from numbers like bounce rate and time spent on page, or tracking goal conversions in GA, heat maps help you build up a more sophisticated picture from knowing which elements are clicked or ignored.\n",

    "We’ve seen how heat maps can be used to understand conversion behavior and optimize your sales funnel.\n",

    "Using a simple heat map lets you see if visitors are clicking on your conversion elements, and if not, what they’re clicking on instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s almost always something unexpected.\n",
    "\n",
    "And it lets you answer a question no amount of bounce stats can: why are people leaving your site?\n",

    "Based on that understanding of real, rather than imagined, user behavior, it’s possible to come up with better design and copy and generate much higher conversions.\n",

    "Data from Confetti and Scroll Maps lets you identify user behavior in a more sophisticated way while keeping heat map analysis as intuitive as looking at the screen.\n",
